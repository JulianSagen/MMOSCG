Business Case:
Your business has been invited by the Norwegian government to submit a proposal for a mobile app. You’ve been tasked with the job of creating a website for the app. The details and background of the invitation are as follows: 
The Syrian conflict is disrupting the education of millions of children, in addition to threatening their physical safety and psychosocial wellbeing. According to the 2015 Save the Children report, “The Cost of War. Calculating the impact of the collapse of Syria’s education system on Syria’s future”, approximately 2.8 million Syrian children are not receiving any form of education inside Syria and across the region. Literacy rates were at 95% for 15-24 year-olds prior to the start of the conflict, but Syria now has one of the lowest school enrolment rates in the world.
Achieving reading and writing fluency (literacy) is foundational for lifelong learning, and therefore a particularly important skill for all children to acquire. Being literate in the language one uses at home also makes it easier to learn second languages and hence facilitates the integration into host-country education systems.
However, Syrian children both inside and outside of school are living under the extreme stress of a protracted conflict. Elevated and prolonged stress levels can impede brain development and cause learning challenges, memory problems and emotional regulation difficulties. Given that psychosocial wellbeing is so fundamental for the ability to learn, many of the ongoing non-formal educational programmes targeting children from areas affected by humanitarian crises and protracted conflict include fun, play and stress relief approaches as an integral part of their overall learning efforts.
The rationale behind this multi-phased competition is that the high level of smartphone ownership among Syrians makes a digital approach a scalable option for reaching as many out-of-school children as possible with a learning supplement that can potentially help build their literacy skills and enhance their psychosocial wellbeing.
The project seeks to supplement existing formal and non-formal education programmes and clinical psychosocial support interventions for Syrian children with an engaging smartphone application (game) which is primarily intended for household use.
